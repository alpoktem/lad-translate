Ladino Ortography  Rules

Ladino is a Spanish-based language with different ortographical and gramatical rules. To avoid doing spanish-isms, here are some guidelines you need to have in mind. 

Orthographic Conventions

Consonants

1. 'qu' is written with 'k'
2. 'c' is written with 'k' in following cases:
   a. before the vowels 'a', 'o', 'u' - kaza (house), koza (thing), kupa (cup)
   b. In combination with consonants - klasa (class), kerer (to want), aktuar (to act)
3. At the end of a syllable, in foreign/technical words - rok (rock), tik (twitch)

Punctuation

1. Unlike Spanish, Ladino does not use inverted question marks (¿) or inverted exclamation marks (¡)
2. Use only regular question marks (?) and exclamation marks (!) at the end of sentences

Word-Specific Changes

1. Write ‘muncho’,  ‘muncha’, ‘munchos’, or ‘munchas’ instead of ‘mucho’, ‘mucha’, ‘muchos’, ‘muchas’, respectively

2. Use ‘tener’ instead of ‘aver’ as the auxiliary verb in the present perfect and past perfect. - Tengo visto (I have seen), Eya tenia visto (She had seen)
